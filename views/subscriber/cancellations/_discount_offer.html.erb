    Stop. You can take
    <%= "#{@cancellation_alternative.discount_percentage_vs_current_plan_annualized}%" %>
    off your Jumpstart subscription right now.
  </h3>
  <p class="lead">
    We understand you're thinking about canceling, but we really don't want
    to have to lock you out of all the great stuff we've got in the works.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    How about this instead: click the link below and we'll move you to a
    <strong>heavily-discounted</strong>
    annual plan. How heavy? How about
    <strong>
      <%= "#{@cancellation_alternative.discount_percentage_vs_current_plan_annualized}% off?" %>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We'll bill you
    <%= "$#{@cancellation_alternative.discount_plan_price}" %>
    today, and you won't have to pay another dime for an entire year. That's like
    getting all of Jumpstart for only
    <%= "$#{@cancellation_alternative.discount_plan_price / 12}" %>
    per month.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    This is a great choice if you
    <strong>don't have enough time</strong>
    to get everything you want out of Jumpstart. There's no rush to get your
    money's worth, isnce you've got an entire year (plus we'll be adding some
    great stuff in that time).
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    <%= button_to(t("subscriptions.accept_discounted_annual_subscription"), [:subscriber, :discount], class: "btn btn-success btn-lg") %>
  </p>
  <small>
    You'll be billed
    <%= "$#{@cancellation_alternative.discount_plan_price}" %>
    immediately.
